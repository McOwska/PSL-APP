### **About the Project**

Our project aims to bridge the communication gap between Polish Sign Language (PJM) users and the wider community by providing a real-time translation tool that converts PJM gestures into written Polish. This application is designed to enhance accessibility and promote inclusion for Deaf individuals in both social and professional settings, enabling smoother interactions and fostering a more inclusive environment for everyone.
